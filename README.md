# PAFAssignment
The app is built using MVVM architecture. 

It uses memory and disk caching to load images. If an image is in memory, it's used. If not, disk caching is used. 

If the image isn't in memory or disk, the network is used.

Whenever an image is accessed from any source (network, disk, or memory), it's cached in both memory and disk both.
